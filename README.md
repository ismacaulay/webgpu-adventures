## webgpu-adventures

## todo
- build a proper examples framework
    - look at how the other webgpu sample sites do it for insiration and some code help

- clean up the scripts; they are just hacked bat scripts that are platform specfic. change to node (maybe), or python, or something cross platform

- examples:
    - render a bunny mesh
    - something with compute
    - textures
    - camera controls
    - geometry shader
